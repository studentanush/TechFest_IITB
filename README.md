# 🧠 AI Quiz Portal – MERN + AI (Prototype Build)

A smart AI-powered quiz generation and evaluation platform built for the **UpSkill India Challenge (HCL × GUVI)**.  
Our goal is to create an interactive quiz portal that automatically generates questions using AI, evaluates responses, and supports multi-user quiz sessions similar to Kahoot.

QUIZZCO.AI is a full‑stack, event-ready quiz platform built for educational and event scenarios (e.g., TechFest). It combines real-time multiplayer quizzes, educator/admin controls, and AI-assisted quiz generation to let organizers create, run, and analyze interactive quizzes with minimal manual effort.

---

## Project overview
The **QUIZZCO.AI** is a full‑stack MERN application that streamlines the creation, management, and conduction of quizzes. It includes a complete backend API using Express.js, event-based communication channels using Socket.IO, and a modular frontend built with React + Vite.


The platform supports:
- AI-assisted quiz generation from raw text or URLs.
- Real-time room creation, joining, and quiz broadcasting.
- Speed-based scoring and automated leaderboards.
- File upload and quiz content storage.
- Dedicated admin workflows separate from player flows.


---

## Problem statement
Traditional event-based quizzes require:
- Manual preparation of questions.
- Slow setup and coordination.
- Lack of scalable real-time infrastructure.


This platform solves these gaps by:
- Generating quizzes instantly using AI.
- Providing real-time quiz conduction with Socket.IO namespaces.
- Offering a fully modular admin dashboard for question flow control.
- Supporting multiplayer performance tracking.

- `/player` – for joining rooms, receiving questions, and submitting answers.
- Instant scoring and leaderboard updates.
- Event-driven architecture with Socket.IO.


### File Management
- Integrated file uploads using Multer.
- Storage for reference materials.


### Quiz Lifecycle
- Quiz creation via dashboard.
- Room creation & participant joining.
- Question broadcasting with timers.
- Answer evaluation & scoring.
- Real-time leaderboard announcements.

## 🔄 System Architecture
### Data Flow
1. **Admin** creates quiz → stored in backend.
2. Admin opens a room via Socket.IO → room broadcast starts.
3. **Players** join the room via `/player` namespace.
4. Admin broadcasts a question → all players receive it in real time.
5. Players submit answers → server evaluates.
6. Leaderboard updates → real-time broadcast to all.

## Important workflows

Login / Signup
- Frontend POST -> /api/auth (server-side uses bcryptjs/jsonwebtoken).
- Frontend stores session as sessionStorage during development (commits reference this).

Quiz creation (educator/admin)
- Educator emits `createRoom` to the `/admin` Socket.IO namespace with { hostName, quizD }.
- Server generates a roomCode (nanoid(6)) and stores room metadata in memory (rooms Map).

Joining a room (player)
- Player emits `joinRoom` with { roomCode, playerName, playerEmail }.
- Server validates room, adds player to room.players (Map keyed by socket.id), and emits `updatePlayers` and `getQuizDetails`.

Question broadcast & play flow
- Admin emits `sendQuestion` -> server broadcasts `newQuestion` and `quiztime`.
- Admin toggles `playOnOff` -> server emits `quizStarted`.

Answer submission & scoring
- Player emits `submitAnswer` with { roomCode, answer, correctAnswer, timeTaken, totalTime }.
- Server computes:
  - isCorrect = answer === correctAnswer
  - points = 10 + (totalTime - timeTaken) * 5 (clamped to 0)
- Server updates room.scores and broadcasts `leaderboardUpdate`.

AI generation
- POST /generate-quiz with { text, num_questions } or /agentic-mode with { url }.
- Backend constructs structured prompt and calls Google GenAI (gemini-2.5-flash) using process.env.API_KEY; returns AI JSON response.

---

## Key algorithms & logic
- In-memory room management using Map(): rooms Map stores { admin, quizD, play, players: Map, scores: Map }.
- Leaderboard: convert room.scores Map -> array of { playerName, score } -> sort descending -> emit.
- Scoring function: base points with speed bonus — encourages quick correct answers.
- AI prompt engineering: server builds strict JSON-output prompts for Gemini to produce quizzes with fields: question, options, correct content/letter, explanation, difficulty, sub_topics, reframe.
- DB connection: mongoose connects using MONGO_URL (src/backend/config/db.js).

---

## AI / ML components
- Server uses Google GenAI client to call Gemini models for quiz generation:
  - /generate-quiz (from raw text)
  - /agentic-mode (from URL)
- Python RAG (optional): requirements.txt & models/ indicate a plan or previous attempt to use document retrieval + generation pipelines to ground questions in documents (indexing and retrieval).

---

## Strengths
- Real-time experience with a dedicated admin namespace — suited for live events.
- AI-assisted quiz generation drastically reduces manual authoring time.
- Modular code separation (frontend/backend) and modern stacks (Vite, React, Express).
- Simple scoring and leaderboard logic ready for gamification.
- Extensible: routes, controllers, and middleware scaffolding enables future features.

---

## Possible improvements & future scope
- Make rooms fault-tolerant and scalable: persist sessions/state in Redis (support multiple backend instances).
- Add reconnection & session persistency for players who disconnect.
- Validate & sanitize AI outputs with a strict JSON schema before using them in production quizzes.
- Add tests (unit/integration), CI pipeline, and linting steps.
- Harden security: validate socket events, apply strict auth/authorization for admin actions, hide/secure secrets.
- Provide model download scripts or hosted RAG worker for reproducible AI flows.
- Add production-ready deployment docs (Docker images, Kubernetes, PM2) and monitoring/analytics.

## One-command local startup guide

Option A — Docker Compose (recommended)
1. Create a `.env` based on `.env.example` (see below).
2. Build and run everything:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
- Backend exposed at: http://localhost:5000
- Frontend exposed at: http://localhost:5173
- MongoDB exposed at: mongodb://localhost:27017

Option B — Local (no Docker) — single command script
1. Make sure Node.js and npm are installed.
2. From repo root, run:
```bash
# one-command to start frontend and backend concurrently (POSIX shell)
./scripts/start-local.sh
```
The script will install dependencies (if needed) and run:
- Backend: cd src/backend && npm install && npm run dev (nodemon server.js)
- Frontend: cd src/frontend && npm install && npm run dev (vite)

(See `scripts/start-local.sh` below.)

## Important environment variables
Based on code (src/backend/server.js & src/backend/config/db.js) and typical usage:

- API_KEY=your_google_genai_api_key_here   # required by /generate-quiz and /agentic-mode
- PORT=5000                               # optional (backend port); server.js defaults to 5000
- MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/techfest
- JWT_SECRET=replace_with_jwt_secret
- VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000  # (frontend dev usage)
